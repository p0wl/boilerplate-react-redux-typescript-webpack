# React Redux Typescript Webpack Boilerplate

"Minimal" boilerplate for react with redux in typescript, build via webpack, tests in jest.

Got annoyed by rewiring these dependencies again and again and found a lot of existing boilerplates too mature or missing things.
This is not meant to be used by others or meant to become the best boilerplate out there, it is just a helper for me.

Is missing:
 * hmr
 * css
 * bundling of react & react dom
